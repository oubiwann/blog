<div><br />For the past two weeks, I've been listening, learning, discussing, and hacking various <a href="http://www.canonical.com/projects/landscape">Landscape</a> and <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> initiatives with members of the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/"> </a><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/">community</a> and fellow <a href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical</a> employees. It was an amazing experience, and we've got the next 6 months crammed full of plans... with the next 3 months already spec'ed out.<br /><br />Canonical has surprised me. It's an extraordinary company... both in the modern business-sense of the word as well as the original sense: a fellowship of companions with a common goal. While so far I have only had a chance to hear some personal histories, it's evident that every member of this company is an extraordinary individual with a rich background and a great deal to offer to the whole. Everyone works with an unprecedented amount of motivation towards the company vision, one that is well and tightly integrated into the corporate culture.<br /><br />There is a bright future ahead for this amazing group...<br /><br /><br /></div>
