I've loved riding horses since I was a kid. I have no riding skillz, but I've been on horses (irregularly, and sometimes with large gaps of time in between) since I was a little boy. But *damn* it's amazing riding a horse.<br /><br />So imagine my joy when<br /><ol><li>my girlfriend tells me she wants to rescue two trail horses she's known for a couple years and is able to get a really good deal on;</li><li>they are larger horses (quarter horses), so they will fit me; and</li><li>the larger of the two is named "Twist".</li></ol>Well, they arrived today, brought up from Colorado by our friend Lindsey. They were treated poorly by someone (riders and/or handlers) this summer, and so are in pretty rough shape, but Marjorie has already started working on them and is putting their recovery plan into effect immediately. As soon as they get fattened and happied back up, I'll be learning to ride bareback! Woo-hoo! Or perhaps "yee-haw," in the parlance of our locale.<br /><br />I've got some initial pics up <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/show/?q=twist+timer&amp;w=45112797%40N00&amp;m=tags">here</a>, taken after we got them off the trailer and into the arena. Twist is the lighter colored, larger horse. I can tell you what <em>I'll</em> be doing on weekends, now! When I'm not traveling to Denver. Or hacking python. Or...<br /><br />But, man! I can't believe that I've got a horse named <em>Twist</em>, of all things! How sweet is that synchronicity?<br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/personal" rel="tag">personal</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/twisted" rel="tag">twisted</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->
