The project that kicked this whole thing off just got a series of updates.
In fact, it got enough of them to warrant a new release. However, this will
likely be the last significant update for a while, since I'm going to spend
any time I have for this work on core libraries of jiface and clojang.

Hopefully, the next release of lfecljapp will be using released versions of
jiface, clojang, and the agent.

Stay tuned ...
