A delightful change, to be sure. One of my coworkers published a <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/tea-time-because-we-wont-stand-for-a-standup/">Rackspace blog post</a> about this today.<br /><br />More than a gratutious reblog, I wanted to highlight this bit of lovely coincidence I came across while reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Turings-Cathedral-Origins-Digital-Universe/dp/0375422773">Turing's Cathedral</a> last night: <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Afternoon tea— a ritual introduced at Fine Hall by Oswald Veblen, who, according to Herman Goldstine, “tried awfully hard to be an Englishman”— was served on real china daily at exactly three o’clock. According to Oppenheimer, “tea is where we explain to each other what we do not understand.”<br /><br /><i>Dyson, George (2012-03-06). Turing's Cathedral: The Origins of the Digital Universe (p. 90). Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.&nbsp; </i></blockquote>The part of the book where this quote occurred was discussing <a href="http://www.ias.edu/articles/fine-hall">Fine Hall</a> which was built for Von Neumann's computer team at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies.<br /><br />And, yes, tea time is a great time for our team mates to explain to each other what they don't understand.<br /><br />In case you missed it above, here's the link again:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/tea-time-because-we-wont-stand-for-a-standup/">http://www.rackspace.com/blog/tea-time-because-we-wont-stand-for-a-standup/</a></blockquote><br />
