This was a small conference (I haven't been to one so small since PyCon was at GW in the early 2000s), and absolutely charming as a result. There were some really nifty talks and a lot of fantastic hallway and ballroom conversations... not to mention Robert Virding's very sweet <a href="https://twitter.com/oubiwann/status/316006519646855168/photo/1">Raspberry Pi Erlang-powered wall-sensing Lego robot</a>.<br /><br />My first Erlang Factory, the event lasted for two fun-filled days and culminated with a <a href="https://twitter.com/oubiwann/status/316005811690287104/photo/1">stroll in the evening sun of San Francisco</a> down to the Rackspace office where we held a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Erlang-Factory-SF-Bay-Area/events/109049612/">Meetup mini-conference</a> (beer, food, and three more talks). Conversations lasted until well after 10pm with the <a href="https://twitter.com/oubiwann/status/315330456671367168/photo/1">remaining die-hards</a> making a trek through the nighttime streets SOMA and the Financial District back to their respective abodes.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UTNPsMlxcvY/UQBSsj_BQWI/AAAAAAAAADA/SZjwtfYECMw/s1600/RackspaceLogoMedium.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UTNPsMlxcvY/UQBSsj_BQWI/AAAAAAAAADA/SZjwtfYECMw/s1600/RackspaceLogoMedium.png" height="200" width="191" /></a></div>Before the close of the conference, however, we managed to sneak a ride (4 of us in a Mustang) to Scoble's studio and conduct an interview with <a href="http://joearms.github.io/">Joe Armstrong</a> and <a href="http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2012/speakers/RobertVirding">Robert Virding</a>. We covered some of the basics in order to provide a gentle overview for folks who may not have been exposed to Erlang yet and are curious about what it has to offer our growing multi-core world. This wend up on the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/rackspace-takes-a-look-at-the-erlang-language/">Rackspace blog</a> as well as the <a href="http://www.building43.com/videos/2013/03/26/rackspace-takes-a-look-at-the-erlang-language/">Building 43</a> site (also on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41GEwIq2mE">YouTube</a>). We've got a couple of teams using Erlang in Rackspace; if you're interested, be sure to email <a href="mailto:steven.pestorich@RACKSPACE.COM">Steve Pestorich</a> and ask him what's available!<br /><br /><br />
