Part of what comes with Ubuntu 10.10 is the new <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Multitouch/uTouchArchitecture?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=MTArchitecture-Maverickv5.png">uTouch stack</a>. We been having lots of really great talks in the public IRC channel (#ubuntu-touch, Freenode.net) and on the <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Emulti-touch-dev">general multi-touch mail list</a> (subscription info at the bottom of that page). More and more folks are trying it out, experimenting, and contributing.<div><br /></div><div>As part of the "<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MaverickMovies">Maverick Movies</a>" initiative, fellow employees Gerry Carr, John Lea, and Neil Patel worked on getting this little gem produced (embedded to the left; here's the <a href="http://blip.tv/file/4245457">full-sized version</a>). Gerry has written an excellent blog post about it <a href="http://blog.canonical.com/?p=446">here</a>. </div><div><br /></div><div>This video shows off most of the touch capabilities that were integrated into Unity for Maverick. <a href="http://njpatel.blogspot.com/">Neil Patel</a> (fellow Big Lebowski fan) and John Lea will be working very closely together during Natty to expand this feature set to take more advantage of the gesture capabilities of <a href="https://launchpad.net/canonical-multitouch">uTouch</a>. Simlarly, <a href="http://bitmath.org/">Henrik Rydberg</a> will be working with them to enhance the uTouch <a href="https://launchpad.net/utouch-grail">gesture engine</a>. And all of us will be working on the newest addition to the uTouch family that Mark mentioned in <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/455">his blog post</a>: a gesture language. More on that later :-)</div><div><br /></div><div>For right now, let's check out this video! For the impatient, the target list of gestures in Unity is available in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/View?id=dfkkjjcj_1482g457bcc7#5_4_Unity_Gestures_12733594886_7375074410811067">gestures guidelines document</a>, lovingly put together by John Lea and Mark. As one might expect, there's a lot there. If you skip to section 5, you'll be able to get a nice visual overview of most of the gestures with some descriptive text. For those who chose to watch the video first, here's what you saw:</div><div><ul><li>single taps (i.e., a touch "mouse click")</li><li>a window grab (three-finger touch, let one up)</li><li>moving the window (three-finger touch, let one up, move it around)</li><li>drag up to maximize</li><li>drag up and right (or left) to fill the right (or left) half of the screen</li><li>un-maximize (use the drag gesture on the maximized window)</li><li>bring up the dash (4-tap)</li><li>bring up all windows for one app (three-pinch)</li><li>bring up all windows (three-pinch again)</li></ul><div>Have fun playing with Unity on your touch devices! There's lots more to come...</div></div><br /><div><br /></div>
