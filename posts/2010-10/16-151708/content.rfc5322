The folks at Qt have been working on multi-touch support for a while now. They blogged about <a href="http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2009/04/02/mouse-gestures-in-qt-apps-to-be-or-not-to-be/">gestures</a>, <a href="http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2009/04/20/multi-touch-support-in-qt/">multi-touch</a>, <a href="http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2009/06/23/multi-touch-on-mac/">Mac support</a>, <a href="http://blog.qt.nokia.com/2009/12/02/multi-touch-goodness/">Windows support</a>, and then at UDS in Brussels (May 2010), they shared their 4.8 plans for multi-touch with the Ubuntu community.<br /><br />Until <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/455">recently</a>, there has been no MT stack for Linux. The great news is that the folks at Qt are very interested in getting Qt to work with <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/canonical-multitouch/">uTouch</a>. Stephen Bregma has been working on the <a href="https://launchpad.net/utouch-geis">GEIS API</a> that toolkits will have the option of taking advantage of, and we were delighted to hear from <a href="http://www.albisser.org/">Zeno</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/DDENIS">Denis</a> that the Qt API they have envisioned and planned is very similar to GEIS, and should make for an excellent match. They are going to be talking with the community about this at <a href="http://uds.ubuntu.com/">UDS two weeks from now</a>, in fact :-)<br /><br />In support of Qt's commitment to multi-touch and gestures, I wanted to encourage folks to take a look at their post about <a href="http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2010/10/05/getting-in-touch-with-qt-quick-gestures-and-qml/">Qt Quick, Qml, and Gestures</a>. The source code is <a href="http://qt.gitorious.org/+qt-developers/gestures">now available for viewing</a>, and we've started to dive into it ourselves, and it seems that others are as well (I know some GTK guys who are double-checking their own plans by looking at what Qt has done so far).<br /><br />Also, if you haven't taken <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/products/developer-tools/">Qt Creator</a> for a drive yet, do so; it's an impressive GUI editor/IDE for Qt, and I've really enjoyed it so far. You can enable GUI visual design for Qml projects by going to the "Help" menu and selecting "About Plugins..." after which, you will need to check the box next to "QmlDesigner" (under "Qt Quick"). Also, a nice cherry on top: the Qt Quick design interface <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oubiwann/sets/72157625051901187/show/">looks stunning</a> with the Ambiance theme in Ubuntu -- the color scheme is a perfect match :-)<br /><br /></div>
