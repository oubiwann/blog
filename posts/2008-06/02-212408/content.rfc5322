<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As mentioned before in a few tweets and blog posts, Divmod's been working with Holden Web a lot lately. After lots of brainstorming, sweet jam sessions, and planning, we're finally ready to talk about it: our <a href="http://news.divmod.com/">latest news item</a> says it all :-)<br /><br />We've got <a href="http://about.divmod.com/training.html">information up</a> on the site about the topics covered in our joint training courses and workshops. You can contact either <a href="http://about.divmod.com/contact.html">Divmod</a> or <a href="http://holdenweb.com/contact/">Holden Web</a> with any questions.<br /><br /><br /></div>
