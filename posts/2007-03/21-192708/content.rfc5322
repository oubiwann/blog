<a href="http://www.tummy.com/journals/users/jafo">Sean Reifschneider</a> of
<a href="http://www.tummy.com/">tummy.com</a> (Twisted and PyCon sponsor)
started up <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/FrontRangePythoneers">Front
Range Pythoneers</a> here in Colorado about <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene">a million years ago</a>. Last
year at PyCon 2006 Jim Baker talked about breathing life back into it... and
he has. Today was not only proof of this (and my first meeting) but yet more
validation of the local python community: enthusiastic, motivated and highly
intelligent . Sean presented his <a
href="http://www.tummy.com/Community/Presentations/vimpython-20070225/vim.html
">PyCon 2007 Vim+python talk</a> and Matt Boersma gave his <a
href="http://us.pycon.org/zope/talks/2007/sun/track4/079/talkDetails2">wxPytho
n and XRC talk</a>.<br /><br />Afterwards, I talked with Fernando Perez about
<a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/">IPython</a> and its distributed
computing branch, lead by Brian Granger and Benjamin Kelly (yet another
physics guy/python coder). They are doing interesting things with Twisted and
IPython, stuff that was brought up at the Twisted BoFs at PyCon this year (and
in which radix and I took an interest). I look forward to attending <a
href="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/Developer_Zone/Sprint">the sprint in
April</a> and <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/BrianGranger">looking
over Brian's shoulder</a>, getting up to speed on how they are using Twisted
and what they want to be doing (possibly exploring the use of <a
href="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/conch/documentation/examples">twisted.
conch.insults</a> in IPython).<br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p
