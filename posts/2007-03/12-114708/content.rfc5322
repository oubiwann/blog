As <a
href="http://oubiwann.blogspot.com/2007/02/twisted-conference.html">men
ioned earlier</a>, there was a surprise <a
href="http://twistedmatrix.com">Twisted</a> contingent at PyCon this year, and
I had the opportunity to hang out with both those of the gang that I'd already
met and done some hanging with, as well as those that I had not. <a
href="http://www.lothar.com/blog/">Brian Warner</a> was one that I hadn't had
a chance to chat with much until PyCon, and it was amazing. I plan on
interviewing him in the future regarding <a
href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/FoolsCap">Foolscap</a>, his thoughts
on <a href="http://www.erights.org/">E</a> and python, as well as the <a
href="http://www.allmydata.com">innovative business</a> he's working for right
now.<br /><br />But what the hell, you ask, does this have to do with
"Bouncing Balls"? Well, in addition to going (or not going) to talks,
attending BoFs, engaging in extensive business networking, and eating/drinking
copious quantities food/drink stuffs, we also had time for good old-fashioned
geek fun: watching movies. I do use the term loosely, though, indicating
essentially anything *.mov, *.avi, *.wmv, etc. Brian shared with a whole
gaggle of us the joys of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IT_Crowd">The IT Crowd</a> (all six
episodes), <a href="http://www.stalkingsanta.com/">Stalking Santa</a>
(preview), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas_in_Love">George
Lucas in Love</a> (which I had never seen), and the apparently famous (and
rightfully so) <a href="http://www.bravia-advert.com/">Bravia commercials</a>.
The paint "fireworks" advert filmed in Scotland was just brilliant and
hilarious (be sure to watch <a
href="http://www.bravia-advert.com/paint/behindthescenes/">the making of</a>),
but I left my heart in a superball, bouncing down the streets of San
Francisco. See if the same doesn't happen to you when you watch the <a
href="http://www.bravia-advert.com/commercial/braviaextcommhigh.html">Bouncing
Balls</a>.<br /><br />That video simply mesmerizes me. I've watched it tens of
times and it still makes me feel like a joyful little kid. Just amazing. Side
by side with the insanely awesome cinematography and the astounding colors,
the music makes this a stunning classic. The song has been haunting me since
PyCon and last night I finally had a chance to sit down and search for the
artist. I didn't have to search long, though, as the <a
href="http://www.bravia-advert.com/balls/">Bravia</a> and <a
href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jos%C3%A9+Gonz%C3%A1lez/+wiki">last.fm</a> page
s share all. Turns out the song is "Heartbeats" from José González's album <a
href="http://tinyurl.com/2tnf3g">Veneer</a>, a cover from eccentric Swedish
band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Knife">The Knife</a>. After
reading more about Veneer, I bought it immediately. I <em>highly</em>
recommend it.<br /><br />And, no, I'd never see this ad before; I don't have
TV service. I am of the "pull" school for entertainment, versus "push" (or
"always on").<br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p
