As was just mentioned on the
[Lisp Flavoured Erlang mail list](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/lisp-flavoured-erlang/61AtcsWcdPY/R2rdE6wy0wQJ),
this blog is explicitly powered by users from the community sharing their
stories, ideas, tutorials, manifestos, sonnets, and novellas about LFE and, in
fact, any Lisp running on the Erlang VM.

This was an implicit understanding before, but (to borrow from the
[Zen of Python](), explicit is better than implicit. There's now a link in the
header of the blog where you can [fork](https://github.com/lfe/blog/fork) the
repository. This information is also supplied in the repo's
[README](https://github.com/lfe/blog) file.

We look forward to receiving your PRs :-)
