So I completely flipped out this morning before breakfast: I looked out the bedroom window after a morning conference call, and there are skaters slaloming down the road behind the house. I've got a 3' <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oubiwann/tags/longboard/">Sector9 bamboo longboard</a> and <em>love</em> to get me some slalom action. But I suck. These guys were <em>awesome</em>.<br /><br />I grabbed Sengey (my girlfriend's Tibetan mastif) and took him out for a walk up the hill. The skaters were amazingly friendly and totally mellow; they jumped at a chance to tell someone about their event. Turns out today is day one of the <a href="http://usnationals.coloradoslalom.org/Home.html">Seismic Nationals</a> which is being held in my back yard!<br /><br />I took my phone with me and snapped some shots of the skaters, and they are here in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oubiwann/sets/72157601630850592/">this flickr set</a>. Enjoy!<br /><br />We've been renting this house month-to-month while waiting to move into the house in Valentine, NE. It's a McMansion and not cozy at all, so this skating event has made the past two months here totally worth while.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update</span>: a <a href="http://www.asphaltplayground.com/movies/wv.mov">sweet video</a> of the same event last year.<br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/skating" rel="tag">skating</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/colorado" rel="tag">colorado</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->
