Last year sometime, I received several emails from people wanting me to release the supybot IRC plugins I wrote back in 2005 for svn and RSS updates. I'd actually written for several different IRC bots (both twisted-based, and non-twisted bots) but the code was particularly messy for supybot. During one conversation, I said that I'd really done it all wrong, and the last thing I wanted to do was clean up wrong code. If I got a chance, I would do it right: <br /><ul><li> create an IRC client for communicating to servers+channels</li><li> create a message server running on local host</li><li> process/parse data from the local server to the IRC client (i.e., appropriate IRC channel)</li></ul>Such a flexible design would suit every need I have for writing data to an IRC channel. <br /><br />Turns out <a href="http://radix.twistedmatrix.com/">radix</a> did <a href="https://launchpad.net/publish-bot/">just so</a> earlier this year for <a href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical</a>, as he relates in this <a href="http://radix.twistedmatrix.com/2007/02/bzr-and-commit-messages-and-irc-bots.html">blog post</a>. This is exactly what I needed this weekend while migrating my old IRC bot to a new server. Well, almost all I needed. There were a couple features I wanted to add...<br /><br />Not having worked with <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">bzr</a> or <a href="https://launchpad.net/">launchpad</a> much, I asked radix about branching his code, since I heard that Canonical actually provides developers a way of doing that without leaving the launchpad environment of trunk. His instructions were quite simple, and I summarize them here for the benefit of others:<br /><ul><li> find the project you want to branch on launchpad</li><li> checkout trunk (if that's what you're branching)</li><li> commit (a local action) with a message about this being a new branch</li><li> make your changes (with any number of commits)</li><li> push all your commits to your branch on launchpad</li></ul>The steps above assume that you have bzr installed and have uploaded your SSH keys to launchpad.<br /><br />Here are the bzr commands that I used:<br /><pre>bzr branch http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~radix/publish-bot/trunk publish-logger-bot<br />cd publish-logger-bot<br />bzr commit --unchanged -m "Created branch of radix's publish-bot."<br />bzr push sftp://oubiwann@bazaar.launchpad.net/~oubiwann/publish-bot/publish-logger-bot<br /></pre>The changes I committed:<br /><ul><li> enabled logging</li><li> added log-rotation</li><li> added an HTTP service for browsing the log files</li></ul>The code is available here:<br /><a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~oubiwann/publish-bot/publish-logger-bot">https://code.launchpad.net/~oubiwann/publish-bot/publish-logger-bot</a><br /><br />Forthcoming features:<br /><ul><li> a search form for the log files</li><li> a parser for bot commands, thus enabling human -&gt; bot communications (will probably dust off my old <a href="http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/">pyparsing</a> code for this)</li><li> arbitrary time log rotation (currently it's by day, ad midnight)</li></ul><br />And for dessert:<br /><pre>[18-Aug-2007 17:56:50] [connected at Sat Aug 18 17:56:50 2007]<br />[18-Aug-2007 17:57:00] [wallflower (logger bot) has joined #supersecretchannel]<br />[18-Aug-2007 18:00:38] &lt;keturn&gt; what's a wallflower?<br />[18-Aug-2007 18:20:09] &lt;PenguinOfDoom&gt; It's a flower that grows out of a wall<br />[18-Aug-2007 18:20:52] &lt;keturn&gt; and has an irc client?<br />[18-Aug-2007 18:22:49] &lt;keturn&gt; is it related to an oubiwann?<br />[18-Aug-2007 18:34:00] &lt;exarkun&gt; I reckon it is<br /></pre><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/bzr" rel="tag">bzr</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/canonical" rel="tag">canonical</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/irc" rel="tag">irc</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/python" rel="tag">python</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/software" rel="tag">software</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/twisted" rel="tag">twisted</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/web" rel="tag">web</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->
