<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i class="categories">internet :: techology :: economics</i><br/><br/><p/><br /> <p><br />In Paul Graham's essay <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050207123811/http://www.paulgraham.com/bubble.html">What the Bubble Got <br />Right</a>, he makes mention of several things that many people are <br />discussing all over the net in technological, political and economic <br />circles. Of particular interest are his discussions on value and <br />productivity. Of particular interest to me is how these insights mesh <br />with the visions that others are having of economics, business, <br />management and society in the coming decades.<br /></p><p><br />The following bears greater reflection:<br /></p><blockquote><br />Recognizing an important trend turns out to be easier than figuring out <br />how to profit from it. The mistake investors always seem to make is to <br />take the trend too literally. Since the Internet was the big new thing, <br />investors supposed that the more Internettish the company, the better.<br /><p><br />In fact most of the money to be made from big trends is made <br />indirectly. It was not the railroads themselves that made the most <br />money during the railroad boom, but the companies on either side, like <br />Carnegie's steelworks, which made the rails, and Standard Oil, which <br />used railroads to get oil to the East Coast, where it could be shipped <br />to Europe.<br /></p></blockquote><br /></div>
