I have a friend who needs our help. In fact, there are potentially disturbing ramifications in the trend mentioned below, so *we* may need our help.<br /><br />Here's the deal: my friend is a research assistant at <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a> in Quebec. He is working with his professor with regard to the following topic:<br /><blockquote>"Open source software (OSS) developers who interact MORE with leaders (administrators) apparently contribute LESS (e.g., write less codes). We need more insights into this finding. Basically, we want to know why this is happening. We have speculated that open source software (OSS) communities are public, voluntary-based and self-organized communities. Therefore, if OSS leaders are too controlling, then developers don't contribute as much. This was one of our speculations. I am wondering if any OSS developers agree with this."</blockquote>Sadly, very few of the developers their research team has contacted have given feedback on this matter. Below is the short list of questions they are asking developers. Note that though the example of contribution was code in the above statement, these questions assume contribution to take any of the following forms:<br /><ul><li>source code</li><li>documentation</li><li>answering questions and providing assistance to other users via mail lists, IRC channels, forums, etc.</li><li>grass-roots marketing</li><li>other forms of community involvement that contribute positively to an open source project</li></ul>Okay, so here are the questions:<br /><ol><li>Does the open source project's leader/lead developer have a huge impact on your contribution?</li><li>What reasons would make developers who interact more with core project contributors apparently contribute less to the open source project?</li><li>How would you feel if the leaders of the open source projects to which you contributed became too controlling?</li></ol>I responded when Meral sent me his email with the two examples of <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted</a> and <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> communities, but these guys need many more points of view than a few... and they aren't getting much traction. I feel that this research is important, and when published, could affect how open source projects and contributions to said projects are viewed by a wider population.<br /><br />If this is also important to you, I encourage you to send an email to meral dot hussein at mail dot mcgill dot ca. Give it the subject of "McGill University Survey" and let 'er rip. The sooner you can do this, the better -- the deadline for the first round data is July 13th.<br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/community" rel="tag">community</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/open source" rel="tag">open source</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/surveys" rel="tag">surveys</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/python" rel="tag">python</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/research" rel="tag">research</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/software" rel="tag">software</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/twisted" rel="tag">twisted</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->
