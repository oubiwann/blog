Yes, we had another BoF today. How could we not? "But why?" you ask. "How could it get any better?" Well, if it wasn't better, it was just as insanely awesome as last night's. Only completely different.<br /><br/><br/><br />I don't want to give away too much... there are many others who have a much greater right to share (and celebrate!) this news with you. So I will tease and tantalize instead: exciting things are afoot in the Twisted community. If you ever were curious about diving into Twisted and decided not to, now is definitely the time to reconsider, start checking it out, learning, and getting involved. You won't want to miss out on this.<br /><br/><br/><br />"Do you know what I'm talking about?"<br/><br />"The Matrix?"<br/><br />"Do you want to know what - it - is?"<br/><br /><br/><br/><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/community" rel="tag">community</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/open source" rel="tag">open source</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/pycon" rel="tag">pycon</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/python" rel="tag">python</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/twisted" rel="tag">twisted</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->
