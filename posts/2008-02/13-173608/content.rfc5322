A quick post to let folks know that there is a planned Twisted presence at PyCon this year (last year's was a happy coincidence). We're already coordinating travel and have some BoF ideas up our collective sleeves that are sure to intrigue if not titillate and please.<br /><br />Twisted brothers and sisters: be there or... well, you'll just miss out on all the goodness that is the unstoppable force of Twisted :-)<br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/community" rel="tag">community</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/pycon" rel="tag">pycon</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/python" rel="tag">python</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/travel" rel="tag">travel</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/twisted" rel="tag">twisted</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->
