This dude is just awesome. I've been listening to him casually since college (one of my suite-mates was a big fan). Through my casual enjoyment, my housemate has become a pretty big fan, so I got her the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Both-Sides-Gun-Ben-Harper/dp/B000EGEKWO/sr=1-2/qid=1170120003/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/104-0214958-5330371?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music">three-disc edition of Both Sides of the Gun</a>. Of course, I've been listening to it as well :-)<br /><br/><br/><br />As a result, I've been hearing a much more diverse selection of his music than I've ever had at my fingertips. And I've been listening more closely...<br /><br/><br/><br />This guy is just amazing. He's got sounds and styles that range from Cat Stevens and Mick Jagger to Stevie Wonder and Stevie Ray Vaughn. He's got punk, jazz, honkey-tonk as well as his signature quiet laments. And he pulls it off in a manner fantastical. Not once does it appear as if this is a musician who can't make up his mind; quite the contrary. Everything he does on three-disc album is 100% Ben Harper, 100% committed to the music.<br /><br/><br/><br />Go get it now. Before you get hit by a bus.<br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/entertainment" rel="tag">entertainment</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/music" rel="tag">music</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->
