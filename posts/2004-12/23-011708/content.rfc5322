<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i class="categories">open :: business</i><br/><br/><p/><br />The <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050207123811/http://obf.adytum.us/">Open Business Foundation</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050207123811/http://obmn.adytum.us/">Open Business Materials Network</a> now have a new home at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050207123811/http://adytum.us/">Adytum</a>.<br />Despite being a couple years old, they are still nascent and not very<br />active. Seeing how I didn't renew their domains a couple months ago and<br />they were definitively destroyed two days ago, it's time I found a<br />place to put them ;-) If they ever grow into anything beyond a small,<br />conceptual project, they may find their own namespace again, but for<br />now, Adytum will suffice.<br /></div>
