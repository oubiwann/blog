<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i class="categories">history</i><br/><br/><p/><br /><p><br />So, for my Winter Solstice present, my dear friends Ellen and Megan took me on a tour of George Washington's <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050207123811/http://www.mountvernon.org/learn/explore_mv/">Mount Vernon Estate</a>.<br />It was really cool... not only a thoughtful present (since I've been<br />doing some reading if the pre- and post-revolutionary times), but as a<br />physical frame of reference I will be able to use for years to come. </p><br /><br /><p>In the 8 years that I lived in the D.C. area, I've never toured a<br />site or monument that had as much meaning and substance as the grounds,<br />mansion, slave quaters, greenhouses and tombs/cemetary of Mount Vernon.<br />I would encourage anyone interested in early U.S. history to check it<br />out if they ever get a chance. Not life-changing, but certainly very<br />useful... providing an excellent context for the letters and writings<br />of the time period.</p><br /><p>(rest of entry truncated/lost)</p><br /></div>
