href="http://dreamhost.com/">DreamHost</a> is really into <a
href="http://openstack.org/">OpenStack</a> :-)<br /><br />(In fact, during
recess, DreamHost asked if I would pass a note to OpenStack. I didn't look
inside the note, but we can all guess what it said...)<br /><br />I was hired
specifically to work on cloud stuff here at DreamHost, and we've got a new
team that's super-excited about this -- they're starting to gear up for
increased contributions and community engagement, gettin' themselves some
cloud. We've now got our own <a
href="https://launchpad.net/~dreamhost-openstack-team">Launchpad team</a>,
we're working on a handful of <a
href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/~dreamhost-openstack-team">blueprints</
a>, chatting it up on mail lists and IRC meetings -- you get the picture :-)

work later, but wanted to get a quick cloud-shout-out done before too much
time passed...<br /><br />P.S. We're hiring Python rock-stars!<br /><br
