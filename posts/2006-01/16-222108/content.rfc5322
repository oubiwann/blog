<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i class="categories">natural language :: semantics :: science fiction</i><br/><br/><div class="entry"><br /><p>I am delighted with the silliness issuing forth from<br /><a href="http://schrobox.blogspot.com/">Schrodinger's Box</a>, it <br />continues to amuse and I am always eager to see what the next post will <br />be. However, as I alluded to at the end of my previous post, there is <br />more potential here than satisfying the high-minded call of absurdity.<br /></p><p/>For example, imagine yourself at work, trapped in a project with a <br />bunch of tired people just wanting to go home. You've been tasked by <br />the boss with "thinking outside the box" and you're making no progress. <br />Everyone is grumpy, creativity is harder and harder to imagine. Simply <br />gather a bunch of text for the topic at hand, feed it into webXcreta, <br />and viola -- instant brainstorming material. Proceed to discuss the <br />sentences that webXcreta pops out, easily dig yourself out of the rut, <br />get off the hook with the boss, and run home to pursue the many other <br />distractions of a mundane existence.<p/>This could also be used effectively to alleviate writer's block. You're <br />writing a historical romance in ancient Gaul, with a plot that <br />stretches over Teutonic tribes in Western Europe, through to Rome and <br />into Asia Minor? Well, gather some source material, feed it into <br />webXcreta, and bing-bango! Innumerable ideas and sources of inspiration <br />to get that ink flowing again.<p/>So, yes -- there is some practicality involved. On a slightly more <br />radical note, I'm exploring as possible use of the weighting <br />"algorithm" I used in webXcreta for representation of minorities. The <br />square of the log could be a very effective means of ensuring that no <br />voice is completely suppressed, that no majority ever gains absolute <br />control. I'd like to hear what people with political science <br />backgrounds have to say about that sort of thing.<p/>And then there's the potential role for this to be used in assessing <br />public opinion, popular trends, and predictive analysis. Now we're get <br />to the subject of this blog entry... psychohistory ;-) I'm talking <br />Isaac Asimov and science-fiction: the psychohistory of Hari Seldon in <br />the famous Foundation series. Or at least a part of it. webXcreta makes <br />use of the<br /><a href="http://nltk.sourceforge.net/">Natural Language Processing Toolkit</a> which is a great <br />tool, but we'd need something more to make this science-fiction a <br />reality. We'd need a "semantic processing toolkit". I image that the <br />corpora for such a toolkit would not be tagged parts of speech, etc., <br />but rather semantic tags. Perhaps domain-specific tags for contextual <br />meaning. Then, instead of a grammatical average, you would take a <br />semantic average. Now *that* would be REALLY interesting...<p/></div><br/><div class="now_playing"> Now playing:<br /> <pre>Yes - And You And I (live version)</pre><br/></div></div>
