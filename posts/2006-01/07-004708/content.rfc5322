<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br /><i class="categories">blogging :: atom :: python</i><br/><br/><div class="entry"><br />Well, today I decided I might as well start posting my blogs to<br />blogger.com in addition to my Advogato posts. A couple friends of mine<br />are on blogger, so I imagine I'll start posting more comments there,<br />and I thought it was a shame for the lack of content in my blogger<br />account (I was using it as a placeholder).<p/>I figured it would take no extra work to update it, really -- my<br />Advogato posts are all via email. All I needed to do was write a script<br />to post to blogger too. Well, working with the blogger Atom API was a<br />little frustrating. It's very sensitive, only accepting ASCII-encoded<br />strings, needs certain characters escaped, and returns HTTP 500 with no<br />clue as to what's going on. Anyway, I finally got everything tweaked<br />just right, and figured I would post the python code for doing it, as<br />many of the examples on the net are old.<p/>The code below is copied and pasted from a script of mine, with most of<br />the guts ripped out (I parse from email and do authentication, to make<br />sure I'm the only one sending blog emails). There might be something<br />left out, but this should be enough to get you started.<p/><pre><br />import time<br />import base64<br />import urllib2<br />from xml.sax.saxutils import escape<br /><br />username = 'your_blogger_name'<br />password = 'your_pass'<br />bloggerid = 'some_number'<br />blogger = "https://www.blogger.com/atom/%s" % bloggerid<br />title = 'blog entry title'<br />blog_entry = 'your blog entry'<br /><br />created = time.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ', time.gmtime())<br />body = """&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?&gt;<br />&lt;entry xmlns="http://purl.org/atom/ns#"&gt;<br /> &lt;title mode="escaped" type="text/plain"&gt;%s&lt;/title&gt;<br /> &lt;issued&gt;%s&lt;/issued&gt;<br /> &lt;generator url="http://your_url/atom"&gt;Your Client<br />Name&lt;/generator&gt;<br /> &lt;content type="application/xhtml+xml"&gt;<br /> &lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;%s&lt;/div&gt;<br /> &lt;/content&gt;<br />&lt;/entry&gt;""" % (title, created, blog_entry)<br /><br />req= urllib2.Request(url=blogger)<br />base64string = base64.encodestring('%s:%s' % (username,<br />password)).strip()<br />req.add_header("Authorization", "Basic %s" % base64string)<br />req.add_header("Content-type", "application/atom+xml")<br />req.add_data(body)<br />f = urllib2.urlopen(req)<br /></pre><br /><br /></div><br/><div class="now_playing"> Now playing:<br /> <pre>Yoko Kanno &amp; The Seatbelts - Gotta Knock A Little Harder (Friday, 9:59pm MST)</pre><br/></div><br /></div>
