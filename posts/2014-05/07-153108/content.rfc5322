We have set aside 1 hour for a kick-off discussion that we can continue in breakout sessions, hallways, meadhalls, in #erlang-lisp on Freenode, and on the LFE mail list</span></span><br /><br />Our goals are to not only share plans, but to discover what you want in LFE, how you want to use it. This is an opportunity for us to work together, explore interesting problems to solve, build community awareness around language goals, and identify efforts around which each of us are interested in collaborating with others in the course of subsequent months.<br /><br />We've opened up a <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/cogitat.io/forms/d/1SlQot2mQ8VDcOTfqc9-48CPJpaCX1U1dIkxoEz8fT08/viewform">Google Docs form</a> so you can add your ideas for session topics. Here are some discussion topics that we've come up with so far:<br /><ul><li>LFE Standard Library&nbsp;</li><li>Java Interop via Erjang&nbsp;</li><li>State of LFE/LFE Roadmap&nbsp;</li><li>Specs, Types, Debug Info and Dialyzer: Erlang Core AST in BEAM&nbsp;</li><li>Refining LFE docs and guides, creating a CookBook, etc.</li></ul><div>Add your favorites!</div><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'IM Fell DW Pica'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.15; white-space: pre-wrap;">In the next couple weeks, we'll identify the top session topics the folks have proposed and attempt to cover these during the Erlang User Conference. Robert was able to get us some meeting space &amp; time for this; he's hoping to have something viewable on the EUC site soon.</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'IM Fell DW Pica'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.15; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></div>This is a first step; let's see how this goes, and if people really enjoy it, we can have a real summit next time!<br /><br />Update: Robert has <a href="http://blog.lfe.io/news/2014/05/25/1523-lfe-user-group-meeting-update/">announced the time and place</a>.<br /><br /><br />
