Even though there's no Erlang-specific booth (or a booth by an Erlang company),
the Erlang OSCON presence has been palpable, albeit in a small-town, gentle
way.

Day 2 is starting as this is being typed, and it will end spectacularly:

Erlang meetup / Birds of a Feather Gathering</a>.

Between now and then, there will be:
