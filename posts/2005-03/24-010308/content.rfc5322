blog="entry"><p><br />I've just read the post at <a
href="http://www.blueskyonmars.com/archives/2005/03/23/ruby_on_rails_wins_the_
marketing_war.html">Blue Sky on Mars</a>, and <br />I've got to agree 100%. In
fact, earlier today, I posted a couple small <br />projects I am working on in
the <a href="http://divmod.org/users/wiki.twistd/nevow/moin.cgi">Nevow <br
/>wiki</a>, and mentioned a personal preference for Nevow over Ruby on <br
/>Rails. Personally, I believe one has more power and capabilities at <br
/>one's finger tips with Nevow. And this in no way takes away from the <br
/>simplicity and elegance of Nevow.<br /></p><br /><p>First, let me say that I
am a huge Zope/Plone, twisted/Nevow, <br /><b>and</b> PEAK fan. Each has its
strengths. But as far as general web <br />development frameworks go in
python, nothing compares to Nevow for <br />building custom applications from
the ground up. I know there are lots <br />of tools to choose from (Quixote,
WebWare, among others), but the <br />simplest, cleanest -- and in my view --
the most powerful, is Nevow.</p><p>Nevow <br />has a thriving, active
community, so I propose we give <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">David
<br />Heinemeier Hansson</a> and Ruby on Rails a run for their money. Nevow
<br />and it's community can beat them hands-down. Let's get some amazing and
<br />easy-to-read docs up. Let's get some videos. Let's show the world that
<br />python has even more to offer than Ruby, and a clean web app dev <br
/>framework in Nevow is one of them.</p><p>Here are some Nevow
