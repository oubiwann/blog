<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i class="categories">economics :: governance :: politics</i><br/><br/><p/><br /><div blog="entry"><p><br />Today, I got an email from <a href="http://www.democracycollaborative.org/about/staff_bios.html#thoward">Ted Howard</a> (director of the <a href="http://www.democracycollaborative.org/">Democracy <br />Collaborative</a>) letting me know that there are posters based on the <br />book <a href="http://americabeyondcapitalism.com">America Beyond <br />Capitalism</a> available for download <a href="http://americabeyondcapitalism.com/emailposters/MORE_INFO/index.htm">here</a>. Very cool stuff. Some very good facts to know and <br />be aware of. One that <b>really</b> pisses me off is in 1945 corporate <br />taxes provided 35.4% of federal revenues and now corps are only paying <br />7.4%. That shit just ain't right. I also like <a href="http://americabeyondcapitalism.com/emailposters/MORE_INFO/07_discretTime_poster.htm">this one</a> -- and in to answer their question, <br />no! it's not what I want. In fact, since working for myself, I have <br />changed my work week to less than 40 hours a week. I strive for 30, but <br />would like to get it down to 25 hours/week. With more time off, I get <br />to spend my time relaxing, hiking, volunteering for projects I care <br />about -- improving my quality of life. As a result, during my work <br />hours, I am much more productive and energetic, happy about life and <br />working.<br /></p><br /><p>BTW, if you haven't read the book <a href="http://americabeyondcapitalism.com">America Beyond <br />Capitalism</a>, you really ought to check it out. It's a fast read with <br />some intense (but accessible) data. And it's not a doom and gloom thing, <br />either - there is all kinds of information in it about what various <br />groups, researchers, corporations, communities, etc., are doing to <br />change the immense imbalance of power and wealth.</p><p/></div><br /></div>
