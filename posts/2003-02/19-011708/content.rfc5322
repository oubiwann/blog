Even small endowments, by providing persistent funding to<br />a cause or charitable organization, can create tremendous public<br />benefit over years. </p><br /><br /><p><b>Is there a minimum recommended size?</b></p><br /><br /><p>For a simple, permanently-endowed foundation, many advisors think<br />$500,000 seems to be a practical minimum. This estimate seems to be<br />based on the assumption that the foundation will hire professionals,<br />and if so, little income will be left over for grantmaking. However,<br />this assumption is simplistic and does not reflect reality.</p><br /><br /><p>More good stuff on that page.
