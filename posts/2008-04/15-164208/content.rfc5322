<div><br />Earlier today, I posted to the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2008-April/017451.html">Twisted mail list</a> and to our <a href="http://labs.twistedmatrix.com/2008/04/founding-sponsors-window-closes-may.html">Labs blog</a> about the deadline for the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TSF/FoundingSponsors">Founding Sponsors</a> (individuals and companies/organizations) for the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedSoftwareFoundation">Twisted Software Foundation</a>, so I thought now would be a good time to give a quick status report :-)<br /><br />Things are going well. We're still working with 4 major donors (some of whom are surprising!), with an additional 3 outliers who may or may not donate. We're hoping to have all that confirmed and settled within the next two weeks. For the full list of current sponsors, please see the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TSF/FoundingSponsors">Founding Sponsors page</a>.<br /><br />So what does all this mean? It means that Twisted has a continually-increasing chance of meeting your needs and exceeding your expectations :-)<br /><br />Sponsors will have access to a private email list that is managed by the TSF, and this will be the primary forum where desired features and issues to be addressed will be discussed. The donations help us address resource issues and the collective voice of the sponsors will help provide a focus on important topics.<br /><br />Not only do the current sponsors have their logos+links on the front page, but Founding Sponsors also get this on a dedicated page on the Twisted site in perpetuity. We've got some amazing Google Juice (search), so this works out well for all. We've also been approached by sponsors who are using it as a means of recruiting Python and Twisted talent in their shops. There are all sorts of creative ways that this can be of benefit :-)<br /><br />If you haven't stopped by the TSF pages, give them a look and see if it's something you or your organization could be interested in.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update:</span> Thanks to feedback from <a href="http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Grig Gheorghiu</a>, we now have two domains that direct to the TSF page:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://twistedsoftwarefoundation.org/">twistedsoftwarefoundation.org</a></li><li><a href="http://tsf.name/">tsf.name</a></li></ul>Be aware that the DNS for those may still be propagating when you click on them :-)<br /><br /><br /></div>
