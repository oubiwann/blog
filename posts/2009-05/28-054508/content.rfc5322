Let's build upon them, imagining ways in which they <span style="font-style: italic;">could</span> become a reality. Let's not only munch on the regular diet of the technical "now"; let's plant seeds in many experiments for the future.<br /><br />This post is about thinking of small, mobile devices and cloud computing. But it's also a rough template. Let's do the same thing for a the desktop: how might it evolve? Where will users be spending their time? Let's do it for the OS and the kernel: what radical changes can we envision there? The technology behind health care. Education. Our new patterns of behaviour in a constantly changing world. All of these and more deserve our attention.<br /><br />The more we discuss such topics in a public forum, the more thought will be given to them. Such increased awareness and attention might spark the light of innovation years ahead of time, and do so in the context of an open exchange of ideas. Let's have Moore's law for the improved quality of life with regard to technology; let's take it out of the chip and into our lives.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
