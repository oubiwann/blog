I've been <br />using this open source software called SQL-Ledger (written in perl, <br />unfortunately) to do my books this year; it's a double entry accounting <br />package. It's ugly as hell (I've made improvements -- css and python), <br />but I love it. I emailed my accountant with some double entry questions <br />(checking to see if the lights really are dawning), and I decided to do <br />some checking on the internet, where I found this gem I thought I'd <br />share ;-)<br /></p><br /><p>This is the first thing I've ever read that has made me not only feel <br />good about accounting, but want to participate in the process :-) <br />We'll, the second thing, actually. The first thing was starting to use <br />SQL-Ledger to it's capacity.</p><p>It's kinda fun:</p><p/><blockquote><br />3.1 The history of double entry accounting<p>People had been tracking money (to pay bills, collect taxes) for <br />thousands of years, but it wasn't till the 1400's that the Italians <br />invented double entry accounting. This made banking reliable, enhanced <br />trade and commerce and very quickly Italy became the banking capital <br />and wealthiest country in Europe. It was the 1400's equivalent of the <br />invention of the internet and the dotcom boom. They had buckets of <br />money to spend. They spent it on paintings of Adam talking to God done <br />on black velvet. Well they would have but velvet hadn't been invented <br />yet. They made do with what they had, which was plaster ceilings. They <br />spent money on painters, sculptors and people like Leonardo da Vinci.</p><p>In grade school this period is called the Renaissance, a flowering of <br />art and intellect, that appeared in Italy for no obvious reason and <br />then spread to the rest of Europe.</p><p>Quite why all these geniuses suddenly appear without any warning is not <br />explained by your history teachers (who spend their life pondering deep <br />questions like this), but Jared Diamond (Guns, Germs and Steel, Pub: <br />Norton 1997) is happy to tell you. He says that geniuses like <br />Michealangelo and Einstein are rather commonplace. Most of them are <br />oppressed and are living in abject poverty, and are busy surviving if <br />they even do that. Give them a good feed, treat them well, put them in <br />the company of peers and pretty soon they'll be coming up with all <br />sorts of things you hadn't dreamed of.</p><p>The Renaissance then was a result of the invention of double entry <br />accounting, not (as we've been told) a flowering of intellect and art <br />that happened for no reason at all.<br /></p></blockquote><p><b>Reference:</b><br /><a href="http://tinyurl.com/4mg4y">http://www.austintek.com/gnucash/ncsa- <br />gnucash-talk-3.html</a></p><p/></div><br /></div>
