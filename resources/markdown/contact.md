### Email and Comments

Any and all questions about the *o|b* may be directed to
<a href="mailto:oubiwann@gmail.com">oubiwann@gmail.com</a>. There are
absolutely no guarantees that I will respond, as it could be days or more
before I even read my emails.

There is no comment functionality built into the blog itself. Once upon a
time, that used to be a deal-breaker; now, it's just become a more peaceful
way to live :-) That being said, since the blog is now published on Github, you are _more than welcome_ to
[create a ticket there](https://github.com/oubiwann/blog/issues/new).
Same "response" caveats apply, as above.


### Physical Mail
