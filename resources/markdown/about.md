This is a mostly technical and occasionally personal blog. Topics run a full
if narrow gamut of topics, ranging from all sorts of howtos to random (and
brief) philosophical musings; from long articles to microblog posts more like
a tweet. My current focus is maths, scientific computing, distributed systems,
and Lisp-like languages.

In 2003, I looked Corry Doctorow for inspiration as struggled to name my blog
-- from his "Outboard Brain", I eventually settled on "Electric Duncan".
However, after nearly two decades of blogging (an activity which has long,
long since lost its original novelty), it was time for a refresh.

As such, the blog title is now simply a branded form of what it is: _o|b_, "oubiwann's blog".
