          <p><a href="{{ site.base<i>url }}/assets/images/posts/Robert-Train.png"><img class="left medium" src="{{ site.base</i>url }}/assets/images/posts/Robert-Train.png" /></a>If you've been watching the <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/lisp-flavoured-erlang'>LFE mail list closely</a>, then you will have noticed that we're working on LFE's first book. That's super-exciting, but for a future post or two all of their own. Several months ago I was getting chapter 1 ready for the reviewers, and I needed some clarification on a few points from Robert Virding regarding some of LFE's historical details.</p><p>So I did what was natural: asked a bunch of completely unrelated questions! Well, to be honest, they were related tangentially and they helped put together a more complete picture of LFE's early history. It ended up being a bit of a mini-interview, and I enjoyed Robert's responses so much, I asked him if it was okay to share with the wider LFE community &ndash; he agreed and the plan was back-burnered for when I had a chance to create a post with the questions and answers.</p><p>Robert and I had a few more related conversations around the same time &ndash; I've taken a bit of artistic liberty in weaving the additional email conversations into a single narrative.</p><p>I hope you enjoy this as much as I did :-)</p><p><hr /></p><p>Duncan: **When did you first encounter Lisp? Where were you working and/or going to school?**</p><p><strong>Robert</strong>: I first encountered Lisp somewhere around 1980-81. I was in the Physics department at Stockholm University and had started taking my PhD in theoretical physics there.</p><p>Duncan: <strong>What was your initial reaction to Lisp?</strong></p><p><strong>Robert</strong>: They were using it at the department for algebraic calculations in theoretical physics which is why I came into contact with it. I was (not yet) a part of that work so, while it was cool, I didn't really see the beauty of it right away.  At that time I was doing programming of more "normal" types of applications, tools for student labs and micro-processor programming in labs, using more traditional languages like Pascal and various assemblers.</p><p>Duncan: **What where the primary hurdles you had to overcome when initially learning Lisp?**</p><p><strong>Robert</strong>: My major difficulty was in grasping that the parentheses defined a data structure and were not just for grouping as in other languages. Why wasn't ``(foo (1) (2) (3))`` the same as ``(foo 1 2 3)``. Once I got that, it was easy. The prefix notation was no problem as I had done some work with Forth (and had implemented one), so I was used to not having infix operators.</p><p>Duncan: **What projects did you work on where Lisp was a major aspect of the work?**</p><p><strong>Robert</strong>: I didn't really use Lisp deeply at the Physics department. They had a VAX 780 running VMS and had <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunice_%28software%29'>Eunice</a>, so I tested <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Lisp'>Franz Lisp</a>.  When I left and joined Ericsson they were also using Vax/VMS so I borrowed Eunice to continue with Lisp. I thought it would be interesting to see if I could port Franz Lisp to straight-VMS. It was much more UNIX/BSD dependent than I originally thought, which resulted in me having to implement more of BSD on top of VMS than I had planned. Maybe I can share those details with you later, they are not really interesting here, for this Lisp discussion.  As far as I know no-one except me ever used it, but it did wonders for my C and understanding of how OSes work!</p><p>I did more work with Lisp when I was a member of the <a href='http://web.archive.org/web/20000817053822/http://www.ericsson.se/cslab/admin/jubileumsskrift.html'>Computer Science Lab</a> in Ericsson where we were looking at various ways of implementing telecom applications. Lisp was one the languages we were investigating, and as part of that work I studied implementing Lisps. I also implemented the Lisp Machine Flavors system as a study of implementing a relatively complex system in and on Lisp ... and for the fun of it as well.</p><p>We later moved on to look at logic languages and these became the base on which Erlang was built, even though Erlang itself became functional.</p><p>Duncan: <strong>Can you tell me more about the Flavors project?</strong></p><p><strong>Robert</strong>: Well, it's probably not well-known that the name LFE &ndash; Lisp Flavoured Erlang &ndash; was partly inspired by the work I did on porting Flavors to VMS, with the spelling changed to the English "Flavours" as a joke.</p><p>Duncan: **Were you using an LMI Lambda? If it wasn't a Symbolics machine, then it probably wasn't ZetaLisp ... so were you using the Maclisp-derived Lisp for the Lambda?**</p><p><strong>Robert</strong>: No, it was other way around. I was using PSL (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Standard_Lisp'>Portable Standard Lisp</a>) from Utah which was quite a good Lisp implementation running on UNIX, amongst other systems. I had heard about Flavors and thought it would be interesting, and fun, to see if I could implement it on PSL. I managed to get hold of the Lisp Machine Flavors documentation and got going.</p><p>Flavors was an extremely feature-filled system; someone had really gone to town with it. It had multiple inheritance, mix-in flavors, before and after handlers, and wrapper macros. It also had a set of rules describing which were to be called and when. It was wonderful. Fortunately, Flavors had a few features which made it easier. For example, there was an explicit ``send`` function so I didn't need to hack PSL itself.</p><p>All in all, it worked. But I never really had a proper use-case. Unfortunately, I think the code has disappeared &ndash; at least, I haven't been able to find it. It would almost be doable on LFE except for updating object state; you would have to modify it to return the new object instead. Or use processes, but then they may be a little heavy.</p><p>Duncan: **After gaining experience in school and work with Lisp, what features did you feel made Lisp an excellent tool or even just fun to work with?**</p><p><strong>Robert</strong>: I liked working with functional languages and I found Lisp to be very versatile when building systems. The combination of functions and macros &ndash; and the homoiconicity which makes working with macros easy &ndash; makes Lisp a very powerful tool. This makes Lisp and the concurrency from Erlang a very good combination.  One wonders how it would have gone if we had used Lisp as a base for Erlang.</p><p>Duncan: **In 2007, when you started working on what would become LFE, when was the last time you had implemented a language? Was it in 1986 when you had implemented the variants of the parallel logic programming languages?**</p><p><strong>Robert</strong>: In addition to the work on the parallel programming languages, I did a number of implementations of Erlang to study different techniques as well as to study the possibilities of using different memory management and garbage collection mechanisms like reference-counting and a real-time copying collector. These presented no significant benefit over the separate-process-heap model used in the "standard" Erlang implementations, so the work was discontinued.</p><p>I did some work with the BEAM implementation, amongst other things, the compiler, and also parts of the basic system.</p><p>Duncan: **Coming back to the parallel programming, I saw a reference to the 1986 paper you co-authored, entitled <em>The Phoning Philosopher's Problem or Logic Programming for Telecommunications Applications</em>, where <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parlog'>Parlog</a> was used to create what looked like an Erlang prototype. Was this the first version of Erlang?**</p><p><strong>Robert</strong>: No, the Erlang language did not exist in 1986; using the name "Erlang" pre-dates the current Erlang language. The 1986 paper was describing a language/system based on concurrent logic which we called "Erlang". It was mainly done by a guy called Nabiel Elshiewy and myself. Actually this path was abandoned and has nothing to do modern Erlang. Which I think is a great shame, as I liked the concurrent logic languages. I still do.</p><p>Work on what became Erlang didn't really start until '87/'88. Before that almost all the members of the lab had written telecom applications in a variety of languages and systems &ndash; basically everything that ran on BSD or UNIX &ndash; to experiment with ways of solving the problem.</p>
